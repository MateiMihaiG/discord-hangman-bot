## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

- Any staff member with **KICK permissions** can type `/hangman start` and the game begins.  
- After **15 seconds**, the bot creates a **public thread** and pings your chosen role.  
- The community works together to guess the word.  
- Once the word is guessed, the thread is **auto-deleted after 10 seconds**.  
- After another **15 seconds**, a new round starts automatically.  
- To stop the game, a staff member must use `/hangman stop`.

### Word management
- ‚ûï Add new words with:  
  `/hangman add category word`
- ‚ûñ Delete words with:  
  `/hangman del category word`
